The reference model is the model with the most ground control points (this should be the most accurate model). I then compare a test model with less ground control points (less accurate) with the reference model. The way I have been measuring the error between my reference point cloud and my test point cloud has been through a tool that identifies the euclidean distance to the nearest neighbor. Although this tool is useful, I have wondered how much of that Euclidean distance error can be attributed to the X-, Y-, and Z-direction. This is an important subject in my research as the point clouds will be used in bathymetry mapping. In bathymetry mapping, Shifts in the X- and Y- direction would not be as bad as shifts in the Z-direction, which is why I am currently interested in finding how much of the error is in the X-,Y- and Z-direction respectively.

This file is a collection of 3-D coordinate points. The number of points in an .las photogrammetry file usually has more than a million points.
